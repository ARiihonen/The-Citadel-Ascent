REMOVE DIRECTORIES: ROOT, MISSION, SCRIPT; THEN UNPACK THIS TO REPLACE. DO NOT UNPACK AND OVERWRITE, MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS GONE FIRST


QUESTIONS TO ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND:
	- where did I get stuck?
		- why? unclear objective? awkward level geometry? arbitrary AI behaviour?
	- where did my camera annoy me?
	- where did Lily annoy me?
	- where did it feel like I should be able to make a jump but couldn't? (even if you made it but it took several tries)

NOTES
- Player should not be able to enter the top part of the fortress (aside from the broken tower with scaffolding)
- Player should have to get Lily to the top of the elevator in order to progress
- Even though the elevator mechanics for the return to the lower courtyard are not present, the player should be able to get to where its roof is going to be if quick and resourceful
- Even if access to the (not present, but will be) elevator during the return to the lower courtyard can't be gained, the player should be able to get into the tower and climb to the top, where progress will be impeded by a roof. This is an intended route and will be opened
- The 2nd configuration of the lower courtyard is only available if you play through the rope breaking event

MAJOR ADDITIONS/CHANGES
- Level is now continuously playable until 2nd visit to the lower elevator courtyard
	- Added mechanics and geometry for
		- Climb back up into a broken tower after losing rope
